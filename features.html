       <li>Assignment 6: (REQUIRED) If the user holds down the left click and drags across the screen, the currently selected object is translated accordingly within the xy-plane.</li>
       <li>Assignment 6: (REQUIRED) If the user scrolls with the scroll wheel, the currently selected object is scaled accordingly. If you don't have easy access to a scroll wheel, it's Ok if you bind the scaling transformation to a different set of controls.</li>
